Apologies if it's been a year since I did my last post. I got a bit lost due to a lot of commitments. But anyway moving forward, right now I am doing some pet projects and I plan to publish them here in Github so try to stay tuned.
Building open source software is also a great way to share ideas. 

So I have this pet project that is a mobile app and also has a server side application. So that's 2 projects I'm working on. I'm almost done with the server side, just a little adjustments to do. 

If you have suggestions please feel free to share them :)
